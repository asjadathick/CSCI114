Assumptions:
Peg1 = blackPeg
Peg2 = tempPeg
Peg3 = whitePeg

All moves will move the top most disk in a peg

REPEAT
	n= number of disks in tempPeg
	if n is even then
		move (n-1) disks from tempPeg to whitePeg
		move 1 disk from tempPeg to blackPeg
		move (n-1) disks from whitePeg to tempPeg
	else
		move (n-1) disks from tempPeg to blackPeg
		move 1 disk from tempPeg to whitePeg
		move (n-1) disks from blackPeg to tempPeg 	
	UNTIL tempPeg is EMPTY AND blackPeg has only black disks

//how move works
PROCEDURE move (n, fromPeg, toPeg)
	move (n-1) disks from fromPeg to tempPeg
	move 1 disk from fromPeg to toPeg
	move (n-1) disks from tempPeg to toPeg
END PROCEDURE
